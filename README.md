**Predictive Machine Learning & Time Series Pipeline for Pricing Forecasts**

## Overview

A modular, production-ready Python project designed to forecast prices of goods, services, or financial instruments (e.g., equity options) based on historical data. The system uses **supervised machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR)** and **time series models (ARIMA)** to generate accurate predictions for the next 12 months from the previous 12 months of data.  

This pipeline is structured for real-world applications and is ready to be deployed.

Forecaster is a modular, production-ready Python pipeline designed to forecast prices of goods, services, or financial instruments (e.g., equity options) based on historical data. Utilizing both supervised machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR) and time series models (ARIMA), this system generates accurate predictions for the next 12 months from the previous 12 months of data.


# Features

Diverse Modeling Techniques: Combines machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR) with time series models (ARIMA) for comprehensive forecasting.

Modular Architecture: Structured to allow easy customization and extension for different forecasting needs.

Production-Ready: Designed with best practices for deployment in real-world scenarios.
