**Predictive Machine Learning & Time Series Pipeline for Pricing Forecasts**

## Overview

`PriceForecastML` is a modular, production-ready Python project designed to forecast prices of goods, services, or financial instruments (e.g., equity options) based on historical data. The system uses **machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR)** and **time series models (ARIMA)** to generate accurate predictions for the next 12 months from the previous 12 months of data.  

This pipeline is structured for real-world applications and is ready to be deployed
